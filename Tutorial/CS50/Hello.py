# There are five data types in python basically: int, float, str, bool and none.
# 'None' is null(Java), NULL(C/C++).
# True/False of bool type, true/false(Java), 1/0 in C.
# Concatenation method of python 2 similar to Java/C++. Like, 'Hello' + name(is a variable)
# Concatenation in Python 3, f'Hello {variable}' , it's much more cool & efficient way,
# just use curly braces to plugin value of a variable.
# input() is a general-purpose function who always going to give you back a str.

name = input('Name: ')
print(f'Hello, {name}')
